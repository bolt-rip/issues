# Bolt Public Issue Tracker

Bolt is an automated ranked service which runs Minecraft [PGM matches](https://pgm.dev/).  To play, you must first join the [Bolt discord](https://discord.com/invite/emM562w) and register your Minecraft account.  The Minecraft server IP is `bolt.oc.tc`.

Bolt is a new service (launched in September 2020) and as such, bugs arise.  Please report bugs or feature requests on this repository's [issue tracker](https://github.com/bolt-rip/issues/issues).  In general, remember to search through the open issues to check whether your question has already been asked.
The Bolt devs will also be using this repository pretty liberally to keep track of their own feature requests/bugs, and you're welcome to simply check in with on-going activity.

Looking forward to seeing you in-game!
